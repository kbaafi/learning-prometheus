# Promtools

Promtools is a utility tool shipped with Prometheus that can be used:

* Check and validate configuration
    * prometheus.yml
    * Rule files
* Validate that metrics passed to it are corretly formatted
* Perform adhoc queries on the Prometheus server
* Debugging and profiling a Prometheus server
* Perform unit tests against Recording and Alerting rules

**Validating a Prometheus configuration**
```sh 
$ promtool check config /etc/prometheus.yml
```

We can use this to prevalidate the configuration before applying it to a Prometheus server.
