# Docker Engine Metrics
To monitor the docker engine on a host, add the following configuration to the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
    "metrics_addr": "192.168.56.104:9323",
    "experimental": true
}
```

Next, restart the docker service

A curl to the the metrics_addr endpoint should reveal the metrics from the docker engine.

`curl 192.168.56.104:9323/metrics`

## Metrics measured
* How much CPU/memory does docker use
* Total number of failed image builds
* Time to process container actions
* Does not provide metrics specific to a container
