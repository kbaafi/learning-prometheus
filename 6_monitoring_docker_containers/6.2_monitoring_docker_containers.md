# Monitoring docker containers

CAdvisor enables the monitoring of docker containers running on the host machine and delivers the necessary metrics to a specified endpoint.

See https://github.com/google/cadvisor/.

A docker-compose setup is available in `cadvisor-docker-compose.yml`. This delivers the docker container metrics to the port 9324 on the host machine.

Once the cadvisor container is up and running, one can add the scraping target for the cadvisor container to the prometheus configuration.

### Some cAdvisor metrics
* How much cpu/memory does each container consume
* Number of processes running in each container
* Container uptime
* Metrics on a per container basis
